        <h2>Pamphlets</h2>
        <p>
          One of the initiatives the Libertarian Socialist Caucus is most proud of is our DSA-LSC Pamphlet Program. In the interests of expanding discussion and debate within the DSA, we have offered to publish Caucus membersâ€™ opinions in pamphlets that can be distributed online in PDF form.
        </p><p>
Unless otherwise stated, these pamphlets do not represent official positions of the Libertarian Socialist Caucus arrived at via consensus; rather, they represent solely the views of the author(s).
        </p><p>
PDFs for printing are available upon request.
